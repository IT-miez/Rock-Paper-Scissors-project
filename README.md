# The Odin Project -  Rock, Paper, Scissors game
This project was made while doing The Odin Project. </br>
I made a couple iterations before I completed my rock paper scissors website with clickable hovering icons.</br></br>

## Live site
GitHub Pages site: https://it-miez.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-project/
</br></br>

## Technologies used
**HTML** </br>
**CSS** (styling, flexbox, hover-effects)</br>
**JavaScript** (results, popup, game-code, DOM-modification)</br></br>

## What I learned
I used my skills on **flexboxes** when structuring the site. I used **JavaScript** to **manipulate the DOM-elements when the game goes on**, adding results, making restart button visible, stopping buttons from working when 5 wins has occurred for the player or computer and a popup to let the user know who won.</br>
In this project I **refreshed my JavaScript-skills**, **and** got to use **flexboxes** again when structuring the website.
